This Python script will help **automate** the creation of the yearly study room log utilized by 
Naperville's 95th Street Public Library Adult Services Department.  

This will drastically reduce the manual time spent creating and formatting a **grand total of 381 Excel sheets**.  
These sheets include:  
- **Daily** study room activity 
- **Monthly** statistics
- **Year** totals

This script will also help "standardize" the formatting to further aid the multiple usages of formulas found in the workbook.
